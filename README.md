This is just a Test of how using the openai API, my conclusion is that we can make every application very smart using this api but it has a cost. 
The API is paid by each 1000 token so it can make it expensive depending on the activity to implement it. 
Here the Idea was to generate details personas information including Image ,background, needs, expectation based on the Profession,Gender and Age. 
The Result was quite Impressing unfortunately I have not token left in my openAIKey but please take a look at the code.
